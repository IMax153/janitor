# Dashboard mockups

Static HTML, no build. Open any file in a browser; the button in the corner
toggles dark mode. `mockup.css` mirrors the tokens in `apps/web/src/styles.css`
so anything here can be lifted into Foldkit views.

## Repository switcher studies

Isolated closed and open switchers, without the rest of the page. Each study
has theme switching, repository search, and selection. Open the HTML files
directly; no server or build is required.

| File                                                                         | Direction                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [7a-repository-switcher-compact.html](7a-repository-switcher-compact.html)   | Compact owner groups with rule and policy counts.                        |
| [7b-repository-switcher-activity.html](7b-repository-switcher-activity.html) | A quieter activity summary: items labeled in the last seven days.        |
| [7c-repository-switcher-labels.html](7c-repository-switcher-labels.html)     | Two managed-label previews per repository, with a remaining-label count. |

All closed controls contain only the repository icon, owner, name, and active
state. Active means Janitor is enabled; revision and synchronization details
are deliberately absent. Repositories, counts, and label previews are sample
data. Counts and label previews would need additional data when implemented.
Shared presentation and prototype behavior live in `repository-switcher.css`
and `repository-switcher.js`.

## What is wrong with the current dashboard

`apps/web/src/components/repositories.ts` renders everything for one repository
on a single page: a repository list rail, an inline panel slot, then Policies,
Rules and Reconciliations tables stacked with an AI consent block between them.

- **Repository selection is a page-level list**, so the rail spends 16rem on a
  handful of names and the rest of the page has no persistent context.
- **Editors push the tables down.** Opening a policy, a rule, or the bench
  inserts a panel above the tables, so the thing you are editing and the thing
  you are editing it against never sit side by side.
- **The policy editor shows no consequences.** Validation is a single line; the
  manifest (facts, tracks, references) and the bench live in separate panels.
- **Rules are a flat table.** Groups and priorities are just columns, so the
  exclusive-group semantics that decide which label wins are invisible.
- **Nothing shows what the system did.** Reconciliations render as ids and
  generations rather than label changes on numbered items.
- **Copy is generic.** "On no match: ensure-absent" reads as a wire value, not
  as an instruction to the maintainer.

## The mockups

Every mockup keeps the same header: brand, a **repository switcher** that sets
the context for the whole dashboard (`⌘K`), page tabs with counts, revision
status, sync, theme. Mockup 2 shows the switcher open.

| File                        | Page          | Idea                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1-policy-workbench.html`   | Policy editor | Three panes: policy rail, editor with completion, inspector (manifest, track readiness, quick bench, bindings). Status bar carries draft/publish state.                                                                      |
| `2-policy-split-bench.html` | Policy editor | Editor left, full bench right as a table with an inline trace drawer. Segmented control switches the bench subject between draft, published, and whole configuration.                                                        |
| `3-rules-ledger.html`       | Rules         | Revision pipeline strip, rules grouped by exclusive group with drag priorities and a 7-day sparkline, inline edit row with plain-language explanation of the two settings, labels rail showing bound/unbound/missing labels. |
| `4-rules-board.html`        | Rules         | Each rule drawn as a pipeline (policy → add label · no match → remove/leave), recent decisions under the table, and a side sheet editor with radio explanations, live preview, and a conflict banner.                        |

## Decisions the mockups take

- Repository is global context, chosen in the header, not a sidebar list.
- Policies, Rules, and Activity are separate tabs. The current single page hides
  too much below the fold once a repository has more than a few policies.
- No modals for editing. Inline rows (mockup 3) or a side sheet (mockup 4) keep
  the table in view.
- Every save names the revision it creates, and the header shows whether that
  revision is active or waiting on a track.
- The bench is never more than one click from the editor, and the editor pages
  show a summary of the last run without opening it.

## Round 2: calmer workbench variants

Built on mockup 1 with more spacing and less chrome. `workbench.css` adds the
sidebar styles and larger control sizes.

| File                           | Navigation                                                    | Layout                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `5a-workbench-sidebar.html`    | Vertical sidebar with the repository switcher at the top      | Policy list, editor, and a sparse inspector (validation, tracks, last test as three numbers, used by, published).            |
| `5b-workbench-nested-nav.html` | Vertical sidebar with policies nested under the Policies item | Two panes only: editor and a column of cards (status, test, used by, history). No separate policy list.                      |
| `5c-workbench-focused.html`    | Top tabs                                                      | One centered column: editor, then a 2×2 grid of cards below it. Reads like a document page.                                  |
| `5d-workbench-rail-bench.html` | Icon rail                                                     | Policy list, editor above, bench below as a full-width table. Inspector information is folded into one line in the page bar. |

## Round 3: the rest of the app in the 5a style

| File                     | Screen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `6a-policy-bench.html`   | Bench opened from a policy. Table of open items with draft and published outcomes side by side, a "would" column, and a trace card plus facts card for the selected row.                                                                  |
| `6b-policy-history.html` | Version list on the left, a diff between versions on the right, with what the selected version read and which rules used it.                                                                                                              |
| `6c-rules.html`          | Same three panes as 5a: rule list grouped by exclusive group with enable switches, the selected rule as a form (label, policy, no-match choice, group, drag-to-order), and an inspector with policy, tracks, preview counts, and history. |
| `6d-activity.html`       | Day-grouped feed mixing label changes and configuration changes, with a status pill and a one-line reason under each item.                                                                                                                |
| `6e-home.html`           | Four stats, one attention banner, recent label changes, synchronization per track, AI toggle, and a needs-attention list.                                                                                                                 |

## The Tailwind port

`tw/` holds the chosen design (`5a-workbench-sidebar.html`) rewritten with
Tailwind v4 utilities, ready to move into Foldkit a component at a time. The
CSS-file mockups above stay as they are; they are the reference, not the
source.

| File                       | What it is                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tw/policy-workbench.html` | The policy screen. Regions are separated by comments naming the Foldkit component each will become.                                                                               |
| `tw/theme.css`             | Tailwind entry. The token block is copied from `apps/web/src/styles.css`, plus the status colours (`ok`, `warn`, `info`) and the JSON syntax colours the app does not define yet. |
| `tw/policy-workbench.css`  | Compiled output, checked in so the page opens without a build step.                                                                                                               |
| `tw/build.mjs`             | Recompiles it: `node docs/mockups/tw/build.mjs`. There is no Tailwind CLI in the workspace, so this drives the compiler the Vite plugin uses.                                     |

Porting notes:

- The status and syntax colours are the only tokens the app is missing. Add
  them to `apps/web/src/styles.css` first, then delete them from `theme.css`.
- The editor markup is a stand-in for CodeMirror's DOM. Only the frame, the
  gutter, and the completion popup are worth porting; CodeMirror renders the
  lines.
- Repeated utility strings (the nav link, the policy row, the pill) are the
  seams. Each is one Foldkit view function.
- Label colours come from GitHub, so they stay inline styles rather than
  classes.
